# Architecture

## Introduction

Our vision is to develop a user-friendly, specialized tool that prioritizes both security auditing and performance monitoring. This tool will be deployed in Windows and virtual Linux environments and will use a database for data storage.

The tool aims to assist the infrastructure team in maintaining performance and security by collecting and presenting critical data through a command-line interface. Key security vulnerabilities monitored include open ports, insecure permissions, high system load, and database performance. Critical issues are highlighted through visual representations such as graphs, tables, and lists.

## System Overview

### High-Level Description

The system is a specialized monitoring and auditing tool designed to enhance security and performance in Windows and Linux environments. It integrates with a database for storing log files, helping the infrastructure team proactively identify and address security vulnerabilities and performance issues. By collecting, storing, and presenting data in a user-friendly format, the system ensures both security and operational efficiency.

### Key Features

- **Security Auditing**: Monitors and identifies vulnerabilities such as open ports, insecure permissions, and high system loads.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks performance metrics, focusing on database performance and system resource usage.
- **Data Collection and Storage**: Aggregates data from various sources and stores it in a central database for easy retrieval and historical analysis.
- **User Interface**: Offers both a command-line interface and a web-based interface for flexible data access and presentation.
- **Alerting and Reporting**: Generates alerts and presents them through graphs, tables, and lists for quick decision-making.
